# SeeWrite AI - Your Intelligent Learning Companion

## üéØ Inspiration

My journey with SeeWrite AI began in the lecture hall. As a developer who is short-sighted, I've constantly struggled to see presentations, diagrams on a whiteboard, or details on a shared screen from my seat. It's a frustrating barrier that disconnects you from the flow of information. I realized that if I was facing this, countless others were too‚Äîwhether due to short-sightedness, other vision impairments, or even just sitting at the back of a large room.

I saw the incredible advancements in generative AI, not as a technical curiosity, but as a practical solution to this very personal problem. I envisioned a tool that could act as my personal pair of front-row glasses, bringing distant visual content directly to me in an accessible and interactive format.
