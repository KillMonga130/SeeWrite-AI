> *Transforming visual learning through AI-powered accessibility solutions*

## 🌟 Overview

SeeWrite AI is an intelligent learning companion designed to break down barriers in educational accessibility. Using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) and Amazon Polly, it transforms static visual educational content into accessible, interactive learning experiences.

**🏆 Built for AWS Breaking Barriers Virtual Challenge 2025**

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Students with visual impairments or those unable to clearly see educational content face significant barriers to learning. SeeWrite AI provides:

- **Detailed AI Analysis** of educational images and diagrams
- **Interactive Q&A** for deeper understanding
- **High-Quality Audio** descriptions and responses
- **Accessibility-First** design with full screen reader support

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML/JS) → API Gateway → Lambda Functions → AWS AI Services
                                      ↓
                              ┌─────────────────┐
                              │   AWS Bedrock   │ (Claude 3 Sonnet)
                              │   Amazon Polly  │ (Neural TTS)
                              │   CloudWatch    │ (Monitoring)
                              └─────────────────┘
```
