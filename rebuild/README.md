# SeeWrite AI - Breaking Barriers in Educational Accessibility

> *Transforming visual learning through AI-powered accessibility solutions*

## 🌟 Overview

SeeWrite AI is an intelligent learning companion designed to break down barriers in educational accessibility. Born from the personal experience of struggling to see presentations and diagrams in lecture halls, this application leverages cutting-edge AWS AI services to transform static visual content into accessible, interactive learning experiences.

### The Problem We Solve

- **Visual Barriers**: Students with vision impairments or those sitting far from visual content struggle to access educational materials
- **Limited Interaction**: Traditional accessibility solutions provide basic descriptions without interactive learning opportunities
- **Educational Inequality**: Lack of accessible tools creates unequal learning experiences

### Our Solution

SeeWrite AI provides:
- **Detailed Audio Descriptions**: AI-powered analysis of educational images with comprehensive, contextual descriptions
- **Interactive Q&A**: Natural language conversations about visual content for deeper understanding
- **On-Demand Audio**: High-quality text-to-speech for all content
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant analysis and response generation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Serverless AWS Architecture
```
Frontend (HTML/JS) → API Gateway → Lambda Functions → AWS AI Services
                                      ↓
                              ┌─────────────────┐
                              │   AWS Bedrock   │ (Claude 3 Sonnet)
                              │   Amazon Polly  │ (Neural TTS)
                              │   CloudWatch    │ (Monitoring)
                              └─────────────────┘
```

### Core Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Clean, accessible HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
   - Responsive design with ARIA compliance
   - Real-time audio playback and interaction

2. **Image Processor Lambda**
   - Processes educational images using Claude 3 Sonnet
   - Generates comprehensive educational descriptions
   - Creates audio descriptions using Amazon Polly

3. **Q&A Chat Lambda**
   - Handles interactive questions about processed content
   - Maintains context from original image analysis
   - Provides educational, contextual responses

4. **Audio Generator Lambda**
   - Standalone audio generation service
   - High-quality neural TTS with multiple voice options
   - Optimized for educational content delivery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Access to AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet model)
- Bash shell for deployment script

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the rebuild directory
cd rebuild/

# Ensure deployment script is executable
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# Run the complete deployment
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script will:
- ✅ Check prerequisites and AWS access
- 📦 Package Lambda functions
- 🏗️ Deploy CloudFormation infrastructure
- 🔄 Update Lambda function code
- 🌐 Configure API Gateway endpoints
- 🧪 Run basic deployment tests

### 3. Configure Frontend

After deployment, the script will automatically update the frontend configuration with your API Gateway URLs.

### 4. Test the Application

1. Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser
2. Upload an educational image (diagram, textbook page, etc.)
3. Click "Analyze Image" to process with AI
4. Listen to the generated audio description
5. Ask follow-up questions in the Q&A section

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html          # Main application interface
│   └── script.js           # Frontend JavaScript logic
├── backend/

├── deploy.sh              # Automated deployment script
└── README.md              # This documentation
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The Lambda functions use these environment variables:
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Deployment environment (dev/staging/prod)
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Project identifier for resource naming

### API Endpoints

After deployment, your API will have these endpoints:
- `POST /process-image`: Analyze educational images
- `POST /chat`: Interactive Q&A about content
- `POST /generate-audio`: On-demand audio generation

### Customization Options

1. **Voice Selection**: Modify `voice_id` in audio generation requests
2. **Model Parameters**: Adjust Claude 3 Sonnet parameters in Lambda functions
3. **UI Styling**: Customize frontend appearance in `index.html`

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### 1. Analyzing a Biology Diagram

```javascript
// Upload image and get analysis
const response = await fetch('/process-image', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: base64Image })
});
```

### 2. Asking Follow-up Questions

```javascript
// Ask specific questions about the content
const response = await fetch('/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        question: "What does the mitochondria do?",
        original_description: previousAnalysis
    })
});
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: Images and conversations are not permanently stored
- **CORS Protection**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access for all AWS services
- **Encryption**: All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Comprehensive logging for all Lambda functions
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error messages and stack traces
- **Performance Metrics**: Function duration and memory usage monitoring

## 🌍 Accessibility Features

- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA compliance and semantic HTML
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **High Contrast**: Accessible color schemes and visual design
- **Audio-First Design**: Primary interaction through audio content

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Live lecture analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: International accessibility
- **LMS Integration**: Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard plugins
- **Tactile Graphics**: 3D printing instructions for diagrams
- **Advanced Personalization**: Learning style adaptation
